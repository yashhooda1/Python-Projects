#Project Name: Gradebook
#The purpose of the project is to use arrays in python to organize subjects and grades using Python in a standard gradebook.

#last semester grades
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]
 
#list subjects
subjects = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]

#list grades
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]

#create 2d array of current grades
gradebook = [["physics", 98], ["calculus", 97], ["poetry", 85], ["history", 88]]

#print current grades before making changes
print(gradebook)

#skip line
print(" ")

#add computer science grade
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])

#add visual arts grade
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

#modify visual arts grade to 5 points greater
gradebook[5][1] = 98

#switch to pass/fail grade option for poetry class
gradebook[2].remove(85)
gradebook[2].append("Pass")

#print grades after modification
print(gradebook)
print(" ")

#combine grades from last semester and this semester to print full gradebook
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook
print(full_gradebook)
